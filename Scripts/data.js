<strong>What Is Alzheimer's?</strong><br/>
    Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, 
    leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and changes in behavior. It's the most common cause of dementia.<br/><br/>
<strong>Symptoms of Alzheimer's</strong><br/>
    <span> Memory loss</span>, especially short-term.
    <span>Confusion</span> about time, place, and familiar faces.
    Difficulty <span>communicating</span> and finding words.
    Trouble <span>planning</span> and completing tasks.
   <span>Mood swings</span> and changes in personality (e.g., becoming more anxious, suspicious, or depressed).<br/><br/>
<strong>What Causes Alzheimer's?</strong><br/>
   The exact cause is not fully understood, but it involves a mix of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle 
   factors. 
   Key contributors include the accumulation of <span>amyloid plaques</span> and <span>tau tangles</span> in 
   the brain,
    which interfere with cell function.<br/><br/>

<strong>How is Alzheimer's diagnosed?</strong><br/>
   Alzheimer's is diagnosed through <span>medical history</span>, physical and neurological exams, 
   cognitive tests, and brain imaging (CT or MRI scans). 
   Blood tests may also help rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.<br/><br/>
<strong>How is Alzheimer's treated?</strong><br/>
   There’s no cure for Alzheimer's, but medications like <span>cholinesterase inhibitors</span> (Donepezil) can 
   help manage symptoms. <span>Lifestyle changes</span>, cognitive therapies, and support can improve quality 
   of life and delay progression.<br/><br/>

<strong>How is Alzheimer's prevented?</strong><br/>
   While there is no guaranteed prevention, lifestyle changes such as staying <span>physically active</span>, 
   <span>mentally stimulated</span>, maintaining a <span>healthy diet</span>, managing <span>chronic conditions
   </span>, and maintaining <span>social connections</span> may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.`

<strong>What is Diabetes?</strong><br/>
Diabetes is a condition that affects how the body controls <span>blood sugar (glucose)</span>, an important source of 
energy. There are two main types: <span>Type 1 Diabetes</span> and <span>Type 2 Diabetes</span>. In <span>Type 1</span>, the body's <span>immune 
system</span> attacks the cells in the <span>pancreas</span> that produce <span>insulin</span>, a hormone that helps regulate blood 
sugar levels. In <span>Type 2</span>, the body either becomes <span>insulin resistant</span> (meaning it doesn't respond properly
to insulin) or doesn't produce enough insulin, leading to high blood sugar.<br/><br/>

<strong>Symptoms of Diabetes</strong><br/> 
Common symptoms of diabetes include <span>frequent urination</span> (as the kidneys work harder to remove excess sugar), 
<span>increased thirst</span> (due to fluid loss), <span>fatigue</span> (because the body isn't using energy effectively), 
and <span>blurry vision</span> (due to fluid changes in the eye). Other signs include <span>slow-healing wounds</span> and 
<span>frequent infections</span>, as high blood sugar affects the body's ability to heal. <span>Type 1 diabetes</span> can also 
cause <span>unexplained weight loss</span>, while <span>Type 2 diabetes</span> often develops gradually, and symptoms may not be 
noticed at first.<br/><br/>

<strong>What Causes Diabetes?</strong><br/>
In <span>Type 1 Diabetes</span>, the condition is caused by an <span>autoimmune reaction</span>, where the body's defense system 
mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. In <span>Type 2 Diabetes</span>, the main 
issue is <span>insulin resistance</span>, meaning the body doesn’t respond well to insulin. Over time, the pancreas may 
also stop producing enough insulin. <span>Gestational diabetes</span> can develop during pregnancy, which increases the 
risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. Risk factors for Type 2 include being overweight, not 
exercising enough, and having a family history of the disease.<br/><br/>

<strong>How is Diabetes Diagnosed?</strong><br/>
Diabetes is diagnosed through <span>blood tests</span>. A <span>fasting blood sugar test</span> measures your blood sugar level 
after not eating for 8-12 hours. The <span>oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</span> checks how your body handles sugar 
by measuring blood sugar after you drink a sugary solution. The <span>A1C test</span> provides an average of your blood 
sugar levels over the past 2-3 months by measuring the amount of glucose attached to your red blood cells.<br/><br/>

<strong>How is Diabetes Treated?</strong><br/>
For <span>Type 1 Diabetes</span>, treatment involves <span>insulin therapy</span>, either through injections or an insulin pump, 
to manage blood sugar levels. <span>Type 2 Diabetes</span> is managed through <span>lifestyle changes</span> such as eating a 
balanced diet and exercising regularly. Medications like <span>metformin</span>are often prescribed to help the body use
insulin better. In more advanced cases of Type 2, insulin may also be needed. <span>Gestational diabetes</span> is 
typically treated with dietary changes, exercise, and sometimes insulin to control blood sugar levels during 
pregnancy.<br/><br/>

<strong>How is Diabetes Prevented?</strong><br/>
While <span>Type 1 Diabetes</span> cannot be prevented since it's an autoimmune disease, <span>Type 2 Diabetes</span> can often be
prevented or delayed by maintaining a healthy weight, eating a nutritious diet, staying active, and regularly 
monitoring blood sugar if you're at risk. People with a family history of diabetes or who are overweight should
be especially mindful of their lifestyle choices.<br/><br/>

<strong>What is Anxiety?</strong><br/>
Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome. It is a normal 
response to stress or danger, but when it becomes overwhelming, excessive, or persistent, it can lead to an 
<span>anxiety disorder</span>. Anxiety disorders are conditions where intense fear or worry disrupts daily life. The main
types include <span>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</span>, <span>Panic Disorder</span>, <span>Social Anxiety Disorder</span>, and
<span>Specific Phobias</span>.<br/><br/>

<strong>Symptoms of Anxiety</strong><br/>
Symptoms of anxiety can be both physical and mental. Physically, people may experience <span>increased heart rate</span>,
<span>sweating</span>, <span>trembling</span>, <span>shortness of breath</span>, and <span>dizziness</span>. Mentally, anxiety can cause constant 
<span>worry</span>, <span>restlessness</span>, and <span>difficulty concentrating</span>. In more severe cases, it can lead to <span>panic 
attacks</span>, where an individual suddenly feels overwhelming fear, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. 
Chronic anxiety can also interfere with sleep and cause tension in the body.<br/><br/>

<strong>Causes of Anxiety</strong><br/>
The causes of anxiety can vary. They often include a combination of <span>genetic</span>, <span>environmental</span>, and 
<span>psychological factors</span>. If a person has a family history of anxiety or other mental health conditions, 
they may be at higher risk. <span>Stressful life events</span> like the death of a loved one, divorce, or job loss 
can trigger or worsen anxiety. Sometimes, <span>chemical imbalances</span> in the brain, particularly in neurotransmitters
(the chemicals that help transmit signals between nerve cells), can also play a role in causing anxiety. 
Conditions like <span>chronic illness</span> or <span>substance abuse</span> can also increase anxiety.<br/><br/>

<strong>How is Anxiety Diagnosed?</strong><br/>
Anxiety is usually diagnosed by a healthcare provider based on the symptoms and a person's medical history. 
The provider might ask about specific experiences of worry, fear, or panic, and how long these feelings 
have been present. In some cases, <span>psychological assessments</span> or <span>screening tools</span> (such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale 
or the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) can help assess the severity of the anxiety. Since anxiety can also be 
linked to other medical conditions, doctors may perform blood tests or other exams to rule out physical causes, 
like thyroid issues, that can mimic anxiety symptoms.<br/><br/>

<strong>Treatment Options For Anxiety</strong><br/>
Treatment for anxiety often includes a combination of <span>therapy</span> and <span>medications</span>. <span>Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy (CBT)</span> is a common form of <span>talk therapy</span> that helps individuals identify and change negative thought
patterns that contribute to anxiety. <span>Medications</span> like <span>antidepressants</span> (such as <span>SSRIs</span> or <span>SNRIs</span>) 
and <span>benzodiazepines</span> (for short-term relief) may also be prescribed. <span>SSRIs</span> (Selective Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors) and <span>SNRIs</span> (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) help balance neurotransmitters in the
brain that regulate mood. Other treatments may include <span>relaxation techniques</span>, <span>breathing exercises</span>, and 
<span>mindfulness practices</span>, which can help manage physical symptoms of anxiety.<br/><br/>

<strong>How Anxiety Can Be Prevented?</strong><br/> 
While anxiety may not always be preventable, there are steps people can take to manage or reduce the risk. 
<span>Stress management</span> is key, as high levels of stress can trigger anxiety. Regular <span>physical activity</span> and a 
balanced diet can also help maintain overall mental health. <span>Relaxation techniques</span> like deep breathing, yoga, 
or meditation can help lower anxiety. Getting enough <span>sleep</span> and staying socially connected with supportive people 
are also important for managing anxiety. For those at high risk, seeing a mental health professional regularly 
can help spot anxiety early and provide timely treatment.<br/><br/>
